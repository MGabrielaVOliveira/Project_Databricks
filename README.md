Objective: The goal of this Databricks project was to identify the 5 companies that purchased the most products, the 5 best-selling products, and the 5 products that generated the highest revenue. As a personal goal, I aimed to enhance my knowledge of the platform by applying it practically.

Tools Used: Spark, Python, SQL, Medallion Architecture.

Development: During the project, I used SQL to create databases that were later analyzed. Medallion Architecture was employed to manage the data selection process, allowing for the identification of the most relevant information to achieve the proposed goals. Additionally, functions were adopted to document each column, facilitating data maintenance. I utilized LiquidyCluster to optimize the performance of tables frequently filtered by high-cardinality columns. This approach is particularly effective for rapidly growing tables that require frequent adjustments, offering benefits such as reduced processing costs on the platform while maintaining high performance.

Conclusion: This project was a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical environment, using modern tools and practices such as Spark, Medallion Architecture, and LiquidyCluster. The experience not only provided a deeper understanding of the Databricks platform but also enhanced my skills in data analysis and process optimization.
